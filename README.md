This web app is being built with a TypeScript/React front-end, styled with Tailwind CSS, and will have a MongoDB database using Express to create the API's for the datbase. 





This web app is being developed for a buddy of mine as a potential site to host his Fitness program. The site is built as mostly an informative website, whilst having a login and registration for accessing the blog which will be made for those who are members of the program.
